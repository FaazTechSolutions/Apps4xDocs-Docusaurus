# Role

In Apps4x, a Role is used to manage what users can access in the application. You can assign users to roles and also assign menus to roles to **control access and permissions**.

## What You Can Do with Roles

  - Create different roles like **Admin, Manager, or Viewer**.

  - Assign specific **users to a role**.

  - Assign specific menus or features that the role can access.

## How to Create and Assign a Role

**1. Create a Role**

  - Go to the Role section and create a new role with a name (e.g., "Admin").

**2. Assign Users to the Role**

  - Hover over the created role and click the `+` icon on the right.

  - A popup will appear showing the list of users.

  - Select the users and click the action button to assign/unassign them.

**3. Assign Menus to the Role**

  - In the same popup, switch to the menu tab.

  - Select the menus the role should access and click Save.

**4. Edit or Delete Roles**

  - You can update or remove roles anytime as needed.

Roles help you control who can see or do what in your app.
