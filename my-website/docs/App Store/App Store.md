# App Store

The **App Store** in Apps4x works just **like the Android Play Store or Apple App Store**, but for your internal apps. It contains ready-to-use packages that you can install into your environment. You can also **create your own packages and publish** them to the App Store.

## How to Use

  - Browse the App Store to find the package you need.

  - Click the `Install` button next to the package.

  - After installation, the package will appear in your **Package** screen.

## Next Steps

  - Go to the **Package** section.

  - Follow the setup steps **(Schema Migration → Data Migration → Testing → Activation)** as guided in the package documentation.

This makes it easy to **reuse, share, and deploy apps** across environments or teams without rebuilding them from scratch.
