# Tree Grid

The Tree Grid form in Apps4x lets you display data in a hierarchical (parent-child) structure. It’s useful when you need to group records under a parent row—like showing employees grouped by manager.

## Key Features

  - Shows records in a tree-style view with expandable/collapsible rows.

  - Groups data based on parent-child relationships.

## Example Use Case

If you have a table with:

  - EmployeeId
  - ParentId (manager or reporting person)

The Tree Grid will group employees under their respective managers automatically.
