# List

The List form type in Apps4x displays data in a scrollable list format. Itâ€™s ideal for viewing records, performing quick actions, and using filters or sorting directly in the interface.

## Key Features

  - Display records in a clean list view

  - Apply filters and sorting without leaving the page

  - Perform quick actions (like Edit or Delete) on each item

> Note : The configuration for List is the same as the Table form.
