# Card

The Card form type in Apps4x displays data in a visually rich card layout, offering an alternative to the traditional table view. This layout is ideal for presenting records in a compact, user-friendly, and more engaging format—without writing custom code.

## Configuration Setup

  - Configure the Card Form using built-in options—no manual design work required.

  - You can link the following elements created at the Entity level:

    - **Fields** – Select which fields should be displayed on the card.

    - **Field Group** – Organize fields into sections for cleaner presentation.

    - **Activity** 

      - Activities (forms created in other entities) will also be displayed if they've been linked to the current entity.

      - You can create a form in another entity (e.g., "Notes" in a "Tasks" entity) and display it as an Activity in this entity’s detail view.

    - **Action** – Actions are created in the current entity and appear as buttons in the table row or toolbar to trigger workflows or perform tasks.

  - Use the **Create Icon** option to configure and design the form visually.
