# Card

The Card form type in Apps4x displays data in a visually rich card layout, offering an alternative to the traditional table view. This layout is ideal for presenting records in a compact, user-friendly, and more engaging format—without writing custom code.

## Configuration Setup

  - Configure the Card Form using built-in options—no manual design work required.

  - You can link the following elements created at the Entity level:

    - **Fields** – Select which fields should be displayed on the card.

    - **Field Group** – Organize fields into sections for cleaner presentation.

    - **Activity** – Display activity logs or history related to the record.

    - **Action** – Enable quick actions directly from each card.

  - Use the **Create Icon** option to configure and design the form visually.
