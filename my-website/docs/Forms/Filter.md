# Filter

The Custom Filter in Apps4x is used to filter records in Table, Card, List, and similar views. It allows users to narrow down data using specific fields.

## How to Enable

  - In the Table form configuration, turn on the Custom Filter toggle to activate filter options.

## Configuration Tabs

**Config Tab**

  - **Custom Filter Show Actions**

    - Enable this to show Submit and Clear buttons in the filter.

  - **Custom Filter Position**

    - Choose where the filter should appear (e.g. top, left). This controls the alignment of the filter fields.

## Design Tab

  - Create a form with the type Filter.

  - Open the form and go to the Design tab.

  - Add the fields you want users to filter by and save the design.

  - The filter will appear above the table or selected view on the output page.

  - In the form's data source, make sure to add the filter fields in the query string so the filtering works correctly.
