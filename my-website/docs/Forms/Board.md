# Board

The Board form type in Apps4x displays data in a visual board layout, as an alternative to the table view. It’s useful for showing records in a compact and user-friendly way—without custom coding.

## Configuration Setup (Same as like Card)

  - Configure the Board form using built-in options—no design work needed in code.

  - You can link the following from the Entity:

    - **Fields** – Select fields to show on each card.

    - **Field Group** – Organize fields into sections for cleaner presentation.

    - **Activity** – Display activity logs or history related to the record.

    - **Action** – Enable quick actions directly from each board.

  - Use the **Create Icon** option to configure and design the form visually.
