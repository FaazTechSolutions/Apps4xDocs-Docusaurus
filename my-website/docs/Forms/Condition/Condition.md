# Condition

The Condition tab is used to apply logic that controls when and how data is fetched and displayed in a form. It acts as a filter that ensures only records meeting specific criteria are retrieved.

## Configuration Setup

  - Data will be fetched based on the condition you define.

  - Conditions are evaluated before displaying data in the form.

  - You can use field values, operators, and static inputs to build your condition logic.

## Grouped Condition

  - A Grouped Condition allows you to combine multiple conditions into one logical block.

  - All the individual conditions in the group must be true (i.e., truthy) for the group to pass.

  - If the grouped condition passes, data will be fetched accordingly.
