# Fields

Fields play a crucial role in your applicationâ€”they define how data is captured, displayed, and stored. Once created, fields can be reused across your forms, entities, and collections as data blueprints.

## How to Create Fields ?

**1. Access the Entity**

  - Open your app in Apps4x Studio.

  - Navigate to the Entity where you want to add fields.

**2. Use the Field Creation Options**

  - If fields were already created during Collection setup, they will be stored as Base Fields.

  - To create new fields:
    - Click `+ Create` to add a base field.
    - Or, click `Create +` at the top of the field list to define new fields manually.

## Field Properties & Configuration

  - When creating a field, you'll be prompted to fill out the following attributes:

    - Label
    - Name
    - Data Type
    - Order Id
    - Ready only
    - Hide
    - Mandatory
    - Unique
    - Sequence
    - Client Field
    - Computed Field
    - Json Field
    - Default Value
    - Min - Max Length
    - Pattern

  - **Label**
    - Display name for the field shown in forms and UI.

  - **Name**
    - Internal name used as a column in the database.

  - **Data Type**
    - Specifies the kind of data the field holds. (See Data Types below)

    - Datatype types are,

      - **Integer** (Whole numbers without decimals (e.g., 1, 25, 300) )

      - **Date** (Stores only the date (e.g., 2025-08-04) )

      - **Date Time** (Stores both date and time in one field)

      - **Decimal** (Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 12.45) )

      - **TimeSpan** (Stores a duration of time (e.g., 02:15:30 = 2 hours, 15 minutes, 30 seconds) )

      - **Image** (Upload and store an image file)

      - **Dropdown** (Allows users to select a value from a predefined list)

      - **Relation** (Links to another collection or table in your app)

      - **Boolean** (Stores a true/false value (e.g., Yes/No, On/Off) )

      - **Text Area** (Larger multi-line text (e.g., comments, descriptions) )

      - **DB Computed** (A field calculated automatically by the database (read-only) )

      - **Formula** (A computed field based on a formula you define)

      - **File** (Upload and store file attachments (e.g., PDFs, docs) )

      - **Time** (Stores only the time (e.g., 14:30:00) )

      - **QR Code** (Automatically generates a QR code based on field content)

      - **List** (Stores a list of values (multi-select or repeated items) )

      - **HTML Editor** (	Rich-text editor that supports HTML content)

      - **Button** (A clickable button that can trigger an action or workflow)

      - **Icon** (Stores or displays an icon from a supported icon set)

      - **Password** (Hidden input field for storing sensitive text (e.g., passwords) )

      - **Int64** (Large whole numbers (64-bit), useful for big IDs or counts)

      - **Chips** (Tag-style input for adding multiple short items (e.g., labels, categories) )

      - **Image Slider** (A set of images that can be displayed as a slider/carousel)

  - **Order Id**
    - Determines the position/order of the field in lists.

  - **Readonly**
    - 	If enabled, field cannot be edited in forms.

  - **Hide**
    - 	If enabled, field will be hidden in the UI.

  - **Mandatory**
    - 	Marks the field as required; cannot be left blank.

  - **Unique**
    - Prevents duplicate values; ensures field uniqueness.

  - **Sequence**
    - 	Converts the field into a sequential ID (requires prefix and pattern).

  - **Sequence Pattern**
    - Custom formatting for sequence values (special characters, prefixes, etc.)

  - **Client Field**
    - Creates the field only at the client/UI level (not stored in DB).

  - **Computed Field**
    - Value is derived from logic (not stored in DB); calculated at runtime.

  - **Json Field**
    - Stores value in JSON format.

  - **Default Value**
    - Predefined value auto-filled in forms unless changed.

  - **Min-Max Length**
    - Sets the allowed range of characters or digits.

  - **Pattern**
    - Regex validation for input formatting. Patterns should be defined in the master table.
