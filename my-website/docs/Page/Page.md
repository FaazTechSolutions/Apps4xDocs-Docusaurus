# Page

The Page feature in Apps4x lets you design a layout by combining different elements like forms, tables, collections, tabs, and more—all in one place.

## How to Configure

  - Click the `+` icon on the left menu to create a new page.

  - Choose a `Base Entity` for the page.

  - Open the Page Canvas and select the Form option to start designing.

### Parent Types

When adding a form to the page, choose a Parent Type:

  - **Entity** – Use data from a standard entity
  - **Query** – Use a custom query
  - **Connector** – Use external API data
  - **Function** – Use output from a function

After selecting the parent type, choose the form you've already created under that entity.

### Final Step

To display the page in the output menu:

  - Create a Menu, then
  - Link your created Page to that menu.
