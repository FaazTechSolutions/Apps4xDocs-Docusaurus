# Rules

Rules in Apps4x are used to define conditions or logic that should run automatically when certain actions happen in your app.

## When Can You Use Rules?

You can apply rules to run logic during these actions:

  - **OnBeforeInsert** – Before adding new data

  - **OnAfterInsert** – After new data is added

  - **OnBeforeUpdate** – Before updating data

  - **OnAfterUpdate** – After data is updated

  - **OnBeforeDelete** – Before deleting data

  - **OnAfterDelete** – After data is deleted

## Why Use Rules?

Use rules when you want something to happen only if certain conditions are met. For example:

  - Send a notification after a new record is added.

  - Block an update if a value is missing.

  - Log changes automatically after an update.

Rules help automate logic without writing full code manually.
