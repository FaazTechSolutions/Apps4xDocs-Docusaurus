# Fields

Fields play a crucial role in your applicationâ€”they define how data is captured, displayed, and stored. Once created, fields can be reused across your forms, entities, and collections as data blueprints.

## How to Create Fields ?

**1. Access the Entity**

  - Open your app in Apps4x Studio.

  - Navigate to the Entity where you want to add fields.

**2. Use the Field Creation Options**

  - If fields were already created during Collection setup, they will be stored as Base Fields.

  - To create new fields:
    - Click `+ Create` to add a base field.
    - Or, click `Create +` at the top of the field list to define new fields manually.

## Field Properties & Configuration

  - **Client Field**
    - Creates the field only at the client/UI level (not stored in DB).

  - **Computed Field**
    - Value is derived from logic (not stored in DB); calculated at runtime.

  - **Json Field**
    - Stores value in JSON format.

  - **Default Value**
    - Predefined value auto-filled in forms unless changed.

  - **Min-Max Length**
    - Sets the allowed range of characters or digits.

    - Regex validation for input formatting. Patterns should be defined in the master table.
