# Users

The Users section in Apps4x lets you **create and manage users**, and control what they can access in the application using **roles and permissions**.

## What You Can Do

  - On the Users page, find the user you want to manage.

  - Click the assignment icon next to the user.

  - Select the role you want to assign.

This makes it easy to control who has access and what level of access each user gets in your app.
