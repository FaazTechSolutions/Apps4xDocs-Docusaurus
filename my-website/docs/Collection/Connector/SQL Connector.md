# SQL Connector

The SQL Connector helps you connect your app to a database and fetch data from any table.

You can use it to display or work with database data inside your app â€” without writing code.

## How to Use It

**1. Create a DB Connector**

  - This is needed to connect to your database.

  - [Create DB Connector](../../Collection/Connector/Connector.md) to create a collection or entity if needed.

**2. Create a Form**

  - The form is used to set up where your data comes from.

  - You can create it under an [entity](../../Entity/Entity.md) or [collection](../../Collection/Collection.md).

**3. Choose SQL Connector as the Data Source**

  - In the form, select SQL Connector as the source of the data.

**4. Create a Menu (If Needed)**

  - If you want to show the data in your app menu, [create a menu](../../Menu/Menu.md) item.

  - Link it to the form, entity, or collection you created.
