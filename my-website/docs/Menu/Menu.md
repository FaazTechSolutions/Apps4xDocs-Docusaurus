# Menu

The Menu feature in Apps4x lets you create and manage menus that link to forms, queries, pages, or other content. These menus appear on the output page for user navigation.

## How to Create a Menu

  1. On the left-side menu bar, click **"Add Menu"**.

  2. Choose to create the menu as a **Folder** or an **Object**.

## Folder Type Menu

  - Use this to create a menu structure with no content linked initially.

  - Add basic details like **Name, Icon, Alignment, Authenticate, etc.**

  - After creating, configure the menu by linking it to:

    - Entity
    - Collection
    - Form
    - Query
    - Connector
    - Page

  - Enable **"Authenticate"** to make the menu visible on the output page. If disabled, the menu will not appear.

## Object Type Menu

  - Use this if you want to link the menu to content right away.

  - You select the menu type (form, page, etc.) during creation.

  - Other steps are the same as Folder type.

## Additional Options

  - You can create sub-menus under any menu item.

  - Set the Target to choose how the content opens:

    - Page
    - Popup
    - New Window

  - Edit, Delete, or Update menus anytime.

  - Assign menu-level permissions to control who can see or use a menu.

  - Rearrange the order of menu items to suit your layout.

Use menus to organize your app layout and easily guide users to key sections.
