# Workflow

The Workflow feature in Apps4x allows you to define a series of stages and actions to manage step-by-step processes, such as approvals or status changes.

## How to Create a Workflow

  1. Click the `+` icon in the left menu under Workflow.

  2. Fill in the required details, including the Connector ID (if applicable).

  3. Once the workflow is created, you can:

     - Add custom fields (optional), or
     - Skip and proceed directly to setup.

## Workflow Setup

  - Add Stages to define the steps in your process.

  - For each stage, fill in the required details (name, status, etc.).

  - After a stage is created, you can configure Actions that:

    - Link to the next stage
    - Define what should happen during that step (e.g. approve, reject)

Use workflows to automate processes like task approvals, document reviews, or status tracking across different modules.
