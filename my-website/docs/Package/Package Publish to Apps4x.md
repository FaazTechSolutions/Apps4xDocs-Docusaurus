In Apps4x, you can build an application, convert it into a package, and then publish it to the App Store so others can install and use it.

## Steps to Publish a Package

**1. Create a Package**

  - Go to the Package section and create a new package.

**2. Select Meta Objects**

  - In the package details page, choose the meta objects (like forms, entities, queries, etc.) you want to include.

  - Click Save.

**3. Activate the Package**

  - Click the Activation button at the top right.

  - Once activated, click the Complete button to finalize the package.

**4. Publish to App Store**

  - Click the Publish button (top right) to make your package available in the App Store.

Once published, the package will appear in the App Store, and others can install it into their environments.
