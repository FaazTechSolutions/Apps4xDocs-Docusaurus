# Member

In Apps4x, a Member represents a user who is part of the app environment. Each member has a type that defines their role, such as:

  - **Owner** – Full control over the app.

  - **Admin** – Can manage most parts of the app.

  - **Dev** (Developer) – Can work on building and configuring the app.

## Key Points

  - The Member screen is used to add users as members of your app.

  - A user can be added as a Member with a specific role **(Owner, Admin, or Dev)**.

  - You **cannot create a new member directly**—you must first create a user, and then add that user as a member.
