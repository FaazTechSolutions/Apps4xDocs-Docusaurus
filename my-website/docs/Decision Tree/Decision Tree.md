# Decision Tree

The Decision Tree in Apps4x is used to build and run complex logic based on conditions. It works like the Decision Table, but with a different visual layout. The logic will only run if the condition is met and the decision tree is in Active status.

## How to Create

  1. Click the `+` icon from the left-side Decision Tree menu.

  2. Enter a name and create the decision tree.

  3. Define your conditions and actions using the tree layout.

## Example :

You can create rules like:

  - If Age > 18, set isEligible = "Yes"

  - If Age < 18, set isEligible = "No"

Once saved and activated, the decision tree will execute this logic automatically in the backend.

## Where to Use

You can use the created Decision Tree inside the Logic screen as part of your automation or process flow.
