# Sorting

The Sorting feature allows you to control the order in which data appears in a table—either in ascending or descending order—based on a specific field (column).

## Configuration Setup

  - Choose a field (column) to sort the data by.
    - Common examples include:

      - Sequential fields (e.g., ID, Serial No.)
      - Date fields (e.g., Created Date, Due Date)

  - When data is fetched from the API, it will be automatically sorted based on the selected field and order.

### Sorting Icons

  - Up Arrow (↑) – Represents Ascending Order (e.g., A → Z, 0 → 9)

  - Down Arrow (↓) – Represents Descending Order (e.g., Z → A, 9 → 0)
