# Table

The Table form type in Apps4x allows you to display and manage data in a structured, grid-like format. It's ideal for listing records, enabling quick actions, and applying filters or sorting directly within the UI.

## Configuration Tabs

The Table form includes multiple configuration areas for full control over appearance, functionality, and data behavior:

  - [Configuration](../../docs/Form%20Types/Configuration/Configuration.md)
  - [Column](../../docs/Form%20Types/Columns/Columns.md)
  - [Data Source](../../docs/Form%20Types/DataSource/DataSource.md)
  - [Sorting](../../docs/Form%20Types/Sorting/Sorting.md)
  - [Condition](../../docs/Form%20Types/Condition/Condition.md)
