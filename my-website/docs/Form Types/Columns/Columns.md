# Columns

Columns in the Table Form define what data is displayed and how it's presented in the table view. They allow you to select fields, rearrange their order, show related data, and apply visual enhancements like tags and tag colors for improved readability and user experience.

## Column Configuration Features

**Field Selection**

  - Choose which fields from the Entity or related entities to display as columns in the table.

**Rearrange Columns**

  - Drag and drop columns to change the display order according to your layout preferences.

**Display Related Fields via RecId**

  - Fetch and display related entity fields using RecId (Record Identifier). This is useful when displaying values from referenced entities, such as showing a user's name instead of just their ID.

**Custom Tags & Tag Colors**

  - Add Tags to specific field values for better visual cues.

  - Assign Tag Colors based on conditions or field values to highlight statuses, categories, or priorities.
