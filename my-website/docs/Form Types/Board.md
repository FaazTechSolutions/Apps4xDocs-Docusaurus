# Board

The Board form type in Apps4x displays data in a visual board layout, as an alternative to the table view. It’s useful for showing records in a compact and user-friendly way—without custom coding.

## Configuration Setup (Same as like Card)

  - Configure the Board form using built-in options—no design work needed in code.

  - You can link the following from the Entity:

    - **Fields** – Select which fields should be displayed on the card.
    
    - **Field Group** – Organize fields into sections for cleaner presentation.
    
    - **Activity** 
    
      - Activities (forms created in other entities) will also be displayed if they've been linked to the current entity.
    
      - You can create a form in another entity (e.g., "Notes" in a "Tasks" entity) and display it as an Activity in this entity’s detail view.
    
    - **Action** – Actions are created in the current entity and appear as buttons in the table row or toolbar to trigger workflows or perform tasks.
    
  - Use the **Create Icon** option to configure and design the form visually.
