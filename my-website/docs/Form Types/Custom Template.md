# Custom Template

The Custom Template form in Apps4x lets you create fully customized designs using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data sources. It’s ideal when you need more control over layout and behavior beyond standard form types.

You can use your custom templates in the Page Canvas to display dynamic content the way you want.

## Configuration Setup

  - After creating a Custom Template form, you can write your code (HTML, CSS, JS) directly in the form’s details view.

  - To display your custom design:
    1. Create a new Page.
    2. Add the Custom Template to the page.
    3. Configure it by selecting the template form you created.

  - Once configured, your custom layout will appear on the output page as designed.
