# Studio

The Studio in Apps4x is the main control center where you can **build, manage, and configure** your entire application. From **creating menus to managing users, roles, and permissions**—everything happens here. You can also manage packages and access the App Store.

## Studio menus:
  
**1. Home**

  - Takes you back to the main **dashboard or home screen**.

**2. Package**

  - This is where all your app's setup and components are stored as a package.

  - You can reuse this package to quickly create a copy of your app with just one click.

**3. App Store**

  - A collection of ready-made apps and tools that anyone using Apps4x can install and use.

**4. Meta Object**

  - Shows a full list of everything you've created in your app—like forms, pages, menus, and more—all in one place.

**5. Handle Bar**

  - A smart feature that lets you create small functions or logic without writing any code.

  - These are used inside forms to make things work dynamically.

**6. Parameter**

  - Helps you avoid using fixed (hardcoded) values in your app.

  - Instead, you store values in the database so they can be changed easily whenever needed.

Studio makes it easy to manage and scale your app without needing deep technical knowledge.
